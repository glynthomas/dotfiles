# glynology (glyn thomas) dotfiles

## dotfiles

dotfiles and their customisations are a personal preference and I have no doubt will change over time, as I add stuff, however, I like to keep things simple and minimal, I am currently using iTerm running on OS X with Macports.  In the near future I want to try out zsh and get into Ruby on Rails.


## thanks and acknowledgements

I have delved into paul irish's excellent dotfiles and forked some other changes I picked up on the internet, that's it ... see I told you it was minimal ...
